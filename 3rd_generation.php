 The development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers. 
Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, 
which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers.
Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with third generation computers through keyboards and 
monitors and interfaced with an operating system, which allowed the device to run many different applications at one 
time with a central program that monitored the memory. 
Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than their 
predecessors.</p>

                    In this era, there were several innovations in various fields of computer technology. These include Integrated 
Circuits (ICs), Semiconductor Memories, Microprogramming, various patterns of parallel processing and introduction of 
Operating Systems and time-sharing. 
In the Integrated Circuit, division there was gradual progress. Firstly, there were small-scale integration (SSI) 
circuits (having 10 devices per chip), which evolved to medium scale integrated (MSI) circuits (having 100 devices 
per chip). There were also developments of multi-layered printed circuits.
