 <div class ="paragraph">

 Introduction <br/>
 
 The calculating engines of English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) are among the most celebrated icons in 
 the prehistory of computing. Babbageâ€™s Difference Engine No.1 was the first successful automatic calculator and 
 remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time. Babbage is sometimes referred to as 
 "father of computing." The International Charles Babbage Society (later the Charles Babbage Institute) took his name 
 to honor his intellectual contributions and their relation to modern computers.
 Biographical Note <br/>
 
 Charles Babbage was born in London on December 26, 1791, the son of Benjamin Babbage, a London banker. As a youth 
 Babbage was his own instructor in algebra, of which he was passionately fond, and was well read in the continental 
 mathematics of his day. Upon entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1811, he found himself far in advance of his 
 tutors in mathematics. Babbage co-founded the Analytical Society for promoting continental mathematics and reforming 
 the mathematics of Newton then taught at the university.
 In his twenties Babbage worked as a mathematician, principally in the calculus of functions. He was elected a Fellow 
 of the Royal Society in 1816 and played a prominent part in the foundation of the Astronomical Society (later Royal 
 Astronomical Society) in 1820. It was about this time that Babbage first acquired the interest in calculating 
 machinery that became his consuming passion for the remainder of his life.
 The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often enormous, taking 
 up entire rooms. 
 They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, generated a lot of heat, 
 which was often the cause of malfunctions.
 First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, 
 to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. 
 Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts. The UNIVAC and ENIAC 
 computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. 
 The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951.
