        EDonation was developed by a team of four web developer's to assist charities in fundraising. The aim is to provide tools for both charities and fundraisers to help raise much needed funds. 

        Fundraisers can easily create fundraising pages through the EDonation website, which allows family and friends donate to their chosen charities. EDonation also provides promotional tools to help fundraisers promote their fundraising pages.
 
        Registered Charities, Not for Profits and Trusts can accept donations directly through our website or through their own websites. 

        All donations are securely processed by paypal Payments. We also assist charities in managing their own websites. We provide free services such as Website Hosting to help charities save money. 

        All donations through our site are passed directly to the charities on a monthly basis.
