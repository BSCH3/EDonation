 <div class ="paragraph">    
 <p>

Fifth generation computing devices, based on artificial intelligence, are still in development, though there are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. 
The use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality. Quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years to come. 
The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization.
