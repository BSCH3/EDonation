 The basis of the fourth generation was the invention of the microprocessor by a team at Intel.
Microprocessor-based computers were originally very limited in their computational ability and speed, and were in no 
way an attempt to downsize the minicomputer. They were addressing an entirely different market.
Although processing power and storage capacities have grown beyond all recognition since the 1970s, the underlying 
technology of large-scale integration (LSI) or very-large-scale integration (VLSI) microchips has remained basically 
the same, so it is widely regarded that most of today s computers still belong to the fourth generation.
On November 15, 1971, Intel released the world s first commercial microprocessor, the 4004. It was developed for a 
Japanese calculator company, Busicom, as an alternative to hardwired circuitry, but computers were developed 
around it, with much of their processing abilities provided by one small microprocessor chip. Coupled with 
one of Intel s other products - the RAM chip, based on an invention by Robert Dennard of IBM, 
(kilobits of memory on one chip) - the microprocessor allowed fourth generation computers to be smaller 
and faster than prior computers. The 4004 was only capable of 60,000 instructions per second, but its 
successors, the Intel 8008, 8080 (used in many computers using the CP/M operating system), and the 8086/8088 family 
(the IBM personal computer (PC) and compatibles use processors still backwards-compatible with the 8086)
brought ever-growing speed and power to the computers. Other producers also made microprocessors which were 
widely used in microcomputers.
Mainframes and minicomputers
Before the introduction of the microprocessor in the early 1970s, computers were generally large, costly systems 
owned by large institutions: corporations, universities, government agencies, and the like. Users—who were 
experienced specialists—did not usually interact with the machine itself, but instead prepared tasks for the 
computer on off-line equipment, such as card punches. A number of assignments for the computer would be gathered up 
and processed in batch mode. After the jobs had completed, users could collect the output printouts and punched cards.
In some organizations it could take hours or days between submitting a job to the computing center and receiving the 
output.</p>

                    A more interactive form of computer use developed commercially by the middle 1960s. In a time-sharing system, 
multiple teleprinter terminals let many people share the use of one mainframe computer processor. This was common in 
business applications and in science and engineering.

A different model of computer use was foreshadowed by the way in which early, pre-commercial, experimental computers 
were used, where one user had exclusive use of a processor.[7] Some of the first computers that might be called
personal were early minicomputers such as the LINC and PDP-8, and later on VAX and larger minicomputers from Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC), Data General, Prime Computer, and others. They originated as peripheral processors for 
mainframe computers, taking on some routine tasks and freeing the processor for computation. By today s standards 
they were physically large (about the size of a refrigerator) and costly (typically tens of thousands of US dollars),

and thus were rarely purchased by individuals. However, they were much smaller, less expensive, and generally simpler
to operate than the mainframe computers of the time, and thus affordable by individual laboratories and research 
projects. Minicomputers largely freed these organizations from the batch processing and bureaucracy of a commercial 
or university computing center.

                In addition, minicomputers were more interactive than mainframes, and soon had their own 
                operating systems. The minicomputer Xerox Alto (1973) was a landmark step in the development of 
                personal computers, because of its graphical user interface, bit-mapped high resolution screen, 
                large internal and external memory storage, mouse, and special software.[8]
Content for Question 4.
The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a 
single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The 
Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971,located all the components of the computer—from the central processing unit and 
memory to input/output controls—on a single chip..<br/> <br/>

In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh. 
Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more 
everyday products began to use microprocessors.
